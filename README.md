# OFIs
Process high-frequency equity market data, compute Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) metrics across multiple levels of the Limit Order Book (LOB), and evaluate cross-asset impacts on short-term price changes.


## Libraries Used in the Program

- `os`
- `zstandard`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`
- `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`

## Run
- 'OFI_CROSS_ASSET.py - supposedly runs the OFI calculation, cross-asset and PCA analysis, and visualisation'
- 'zst2csv.py - converts the zst files to csv to be able to view them manually as well.'
- '** main.tex - LaTex file.'

## Results
The programme did not go through - no final plots or coefficients to report, unfortunately.
